# Advent of Code Solutions for years 2021+

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual advent calendar with daily coding puzzles to be solved in any programming language of the participant's choice.

I am okay at solving these, but getting better each year. Currently, I'm sitting at 182 stars but hoping to join the 500 club some day.

In 2021, I solved 30% of the puzzles, for a total of 15 stars out of 50  (Java, primarily)

In 2022, I solved 70% of the puzzles for a total of 35 stars out of 50   (Python, primarily. Rust rarely)

In 2024 I got busy but used node to get 17 stars when I had time

I went back and did all 50 stars of 2016 to learn Golang, which I enjoyed

In 2025, I'm solving puzzles with Rust, which has been a joy to use compared to my first experience with Rust back in 2022
