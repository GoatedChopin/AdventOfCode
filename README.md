# Advent of Code Solutions for years 2021+

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual advent calendar with daily coding puzzles to be solved in any programming language of the participant's choice.

I am bad at solving these, but getting better each year. 

In 2021, I solved 30% of the puzzles, for a total of 15 stars out of 50  (Java, primarily)
In 2022, I solved 70% of the puzzles for a total of 35 stars out of 50   (Python, primarily. Rust rarely)
